# Hi, I’m Greycloudss

Welcome! I build tools and utilities with a focus on performance, modularity, and practical utility — with a strong interest in security software.  
I name this collection the *Armourer Series*: tools inspired by armour, built to protect and enable workflows.

##  Featured Project Series: *Armourer*

- **[Gauntlet](https://github.com/greycloudss/Gauntlet)** – *C++ reverse-engineering utility.* Supports both static and dynamic disassembly and DLL injection into external processes. Built for modularity and performance.

- **[Breastplate](https://github.com/greycloudss/Breastplate)** – *Peer-to-peer, self-healing file-synchronisation layer (Java).* Nodes exchange SHA-256 hashes and reach consensus by majority to keep local folders in sync.

- **[Sabaton](https://github.com/greycloudss/Sabaton)** – *WIP offline password cracker and wordlist engine (C).* Generates exhaustive keyspaces and evaluates them against mainstream hash functions via a simple API; targeted for air-gapped environments.

- **[Greave](https://github.com/greycloudss/Greave)** – *Fast, multi-mode scanner (Python).* Locates sensitive information across local filesystems and Confluence pages.

- **[Greathelm](https://github.com/greycloudss/Greathelm)** – *WIP open-source EDR.*
